  # This was an individual project prepared during the Fall 2022 semester at McGill University.
  In this project, we take a look at the extent of Cadmium in Chinese soils and its impact on vegetable production. China has been chosen as a case study since it is the world's largest producer of vegetables.

  This is a metastudy, meaning the project focused on reviewing literature, gathering data from a collection of studies and deriving insights from them.
