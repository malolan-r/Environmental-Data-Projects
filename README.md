# Data-Projects
 Hi There! This section provides a quick look at my data projects.
 Most of my projects are in the fields of environment and football, and have been created using Excel, Tableau, Python and QGIS.
The projects have been uploaded in the form of PDFs and/or individual images. Where applicable, please refer to the PDF first before moving onto the individual images - this will offer a strcutured look at the data and enhance the reader's understanding.
