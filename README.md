# Data-Projects
 Hi There! This section provides a quick look at my data projects.
 Most of my projects are in the fields of environment and football, and have been created using Excel, Tableau, Python and QGIS.
 In most cases, images and PDFs have been uploaded to provide a quick glance at my projects. Where applicable, please refer to the PDF first for a structured look at my project.
 The images are meant to be referred separately after the PDFs (if present), since the quality of images in PDFs is not always perfect.
